Let us say you have gone to a trip with couple of friends and you are paying for each other, one person can pay for one or more person. So if there are 10 friends then imagine there can be 100 transactions

Someone has to pay you and then you have to pay him and then you have to pay to someone else and that person has to pay to someone who has to pay you

It won't be an efficient thing to transfer 100 times, instead you would prefer net settlement transactions or the most optimal transactions that would settle all the amounts between friends


build by running

gcc main.c -i main


For testing purpose there is a large transactions file, which has volume of transaction and settling in that order would be very cumbursome

Original number of transactions: 88
Optimized Number of transactions for settlemnt of debt: 8
f owes c 1306
f owes a 1117
f owes i 722
f owes h 238
f owes e 187
d owes f 559
j owes f 601
g owes f 617



There is also a small transaction file for the purpose of quick testing by eye balling the results

Original number of transactions: 8
Optimized Number of transactions for settlemnt of debt: 3
d owes c 411
d owes a 336
b owes d 29
